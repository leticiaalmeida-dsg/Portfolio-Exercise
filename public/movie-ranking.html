    <h2>My top 3 movies of the year.</h2>
        <h3>The Substance</h3>
            <p>Most funny, crazy, mind-blowing sci-fi comedy I've seen recently.</p>
        <h3>The exorcist</h3>
            <p>A horror classic, definitely a must a watch for movie lovers.</p>
        <h3>There will be Blood</h3>
            <p>I've become really into western movies recently. Killing acting, pretty bold story.</p>
